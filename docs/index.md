# Paladin TBC Anniversary Classic – Preparation Guide

> A practical guide for preparing Paladins for TBC Anniversary Classic, focused on maximum xp rates post boosting nerfs.

## 1. Helpers Dictates Overall Strategy

**Core premise:** the number of available helpers changes which approach should be taken. 

With dungeon boosting xp killed by Blizzard, mob tagging is the new form of boosting.  
The low level character must tag (deal damage first) and deal 40% of the enemy's hp to gain full xp.  
The fastest possible approach to leveling will be doing zone-wide aoe pulls like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMHqKeDvrBk).
Unfortunately, this approach requires a minimum of 2 60's helping, typically 4 or more as levels increase.  It is unlikely that any guild reaches the player time investment required to offer this service to their    guildies - most likely the only people who take this approach will be streamers and/or people paying. 

A much more realistic helper count would be 0, your own dualbox, or 1 friend.  A level 60 warrior/druid can set up an untagged aoe pull for you (via demo shout/roar) at low levels only, but as enemy mobs near level 20, your pull size for solo tank will start to become limited.  

If your helper class is anything except warrior/druid, or if competition in the zone or enemy mob levels have made aoe impractical, your approach should be single target ret.  
Single target levelers will focus on hyperspawns and potentially some kill quests.

## 2. Types of Helpers

Not all helpers are equal.  Quantity and class both matter.

Class roles:

* **War/druid** pull mobs, druid can give thorns to paladin and self heal large pulls
* **Mage** improved fireblast spec, portals
* **Rogue/lock/hunter/priest/shaman** dps choices for killing tagged mobs, some better/worse, no extra tools
* **Healers** only useful for zone-wide aoe pulls, likely irrelevant
* **Summoners** as useful as the function of their location, some are very high yield (Org bank, hillsbrad fields), some are minor gain compared to alternatives (barrens harpies, SM portal).  

For a solo helper until level 20:
druid > war > mage > other 

From 20-32:
mage > druid > war > other

## 3. Items and Professions

Aoe levelers will need to get [Explosive Rockets](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1178) from alliance either via AH or hand leveling.  They will level engi for dynamites and sappers using any of the existing guides out there, generally leveling as the pulls are set up where possible.  

Single target levelers can review these gear snapshots for ideas on pre-gearing your character.  I'm taking this approach personally and am twinked in every item slot.  

[Level 1](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/hu5PKB8sUk9zQdzDGVMCJK)
[Level 20](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/bVxtYXqHUW7CifofrJ7v4r)
[Level 32](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/okBa9at4cZJdbT7TJMeTho)
[Level 40](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/kPpCErA1oHmLKQ2hNtmi23)
[Level 47](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/pyqZ4JF9vbZjsQhML28JgZ)

Ret players can also consider low level battle elixirs for str/agi.  
To access the engineering helm at level 10, you must stop leveling and push engi to 120.  This may not be worth the xph loss but the helm lasts until level 25 and [Humbert's Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4724) is notoriously expensive.

## 4. World Buffs and Summons

This section explains when buffs are *worth maintaining* and when they are disposable.

Cover:

* Which world buffs meaningfully change outcomes
* Buff persistence vs death-based strategies
* Summoning logistics (lock chains, alts, parking)
* When buffs increase risk rather than reduce it

Explicitly tie buffs to:

* Pull size ceilings
* Survivability margins
* Reset consistency

---

## 5. Hyperspawns

Hyperspawns are an XP multiplier when correctly controlled.

Explain:

* What creates hyperspawns (mechanically)
* Why Paladins exploit them better than most classes
* Required helper configurations
* Common failure modes (over-tagging, leash breaks)

This section should emphasize:

* Spawn pressure control
* Kill cadence discipline

---

## 6. Zone Pulls

Zone pulls convert *geography* into an advantage.

Cover:

* Criteria for a good zone-pull location
* Mob density vs pathing complexity
* Reset vectors and safe wipe points
* How helper roles change during zone pulls

Include:

* Risk management frameworks
* How to abort without losing time

---

## 7. Dungeon Cleave

Dungeon cleave is the most controlled and repeatable strategy.

Topics:

* When dungeon cleave dominates open-world methods
* Paladin-specific advantages in dungeon environments
* Optimal group compositions by helper count
* Lockout math and reset optimization

Tie this section back to:

* Items
* Professions
* Buff decisions

---

## 8. 48–60 Transition

The final stretch is where most strategies collapse if not adapted.

Discuss:

* Why earlier methods stop scaling
* Mob HP vs XP efficiency inflection points
* When to abandon hyperspawns or zone pulls
* Dungeon vs outdoor tradeoffs post-48

End with:

* A clear decision tree for 48–60
* Common mistakes that waste the final hours

---

## Closing Notes

This guide intentionally prioritizes:

* Predictability over novelty
* Repeatable systems over one-off tricks
* Helper leverage over individual heroics

Updates should track:

* Server-specific tuning
* Spawn behavior changes
* Anniversary-specific mechanics
