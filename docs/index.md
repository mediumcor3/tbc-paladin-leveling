# Paladin TBC Anniversary Classic – Preparation Guide

> A practical, systems-oriented guide for preparing Paladins for TBC Anniversary Classic, focused on leveling acceleration, group leverage, and execution efficiency.

---

## 1. Helper Count Dictates Overall Strategy

**Core premise:** the number of available helpers fundamentally changes the optimal leveling and prep strategy.

This section should establish:

* Why Paladins scale disproportionately with external help
* Strategy differences between:

  * Solo / near-solo
  * 1–2 helpers
  * 3–5 helpers
  * Raid-sized assistance
* Time-to-60 expectations for each scenario
* Tradeoffs between gold, time, and coordination

Key concepts to introduce early:

* XP density vs XP safety
* Reset cadence
* Death as a tool (not a failure)

---

## 2. Types of Helpers

Not all helpers are equal. Categorize helpers by *function*, not class fantasy.

Suggested breakdown:

* **Damage dealers** (ranged vs melee)
* **Pullers / taggers**
* **Healers** (active vs passive)
* **Controllers** (slows, fears, stuns)
* **Summoners / warlock alts**

Cover:

* What each helper type enables
* Diminishing returns on stacking the same helper role
* Which helper types unlock specific techniques later in the guide

---

## 3. Items and Professions

This section defines the *minimum viable prep* before execution begins.

Topics:

* Gear thresholds that matter (and those that don’t)
* Consumables that meaningfully affect pull size or reset speed
* Engineering breakpoints (bombs, dummies, reflectors)
* Professions that scale with helper count
* Gold investment vs time saved

Focus on:

* Deterministic value
* Items that enable techniques described in later sections

---

## 4. World Buffs and Summons

This section explains when buffs are *worth maintaining* and when they are disposable.

Cover:

* Which world buffs meaningfully change outcomes
* Buff persistence vs death-based strategies
* Summoning logistics (lock chains, alts, parking)
* When buffs increase risk rather than reduce it

Explicitly tie buffs to:

* Pull size ceilings
* Survivability margins
* Reset consistency

---

## 5. Hyperspawns

Hyperspawns are an XP multiplier when correctly controlled.

Explain:

* What creates hyperspawns (mechanically)
* Why Paladins exploit them better than most classes
* Required helper configurations
* Common failure modes (over-tagging, leash breaks)

This section should emphasize:

* Spawn pressure control
* Kill cadence discipline

---

## 6. Zone Pulls

Zone pulls convert *geography* into an advantage.

Cover:

* Criteria for a good zone-pull location
* Mob density vs pathing complexity
* Reset vectors and safe wipe points
* How helper roles change during zone pulls

Include:

* Risk management frameworks
* How to abort without losing time

---

## 7. Dungeon Cleave

Dungeon cleave is the most controlled and repeatable strategy.

Topics:

* When dungeon cleave dominates open-world methods
* Paladin-specific advantages in dungeon environments
* Optimal group compositions by helper count
* Lockout math and reset optimization

Tie this section back to:

* Items
* Professions
* Buff decisions

---

## 8. 48–60 Transition

The final stretch is where most strategies collapse if not adapted.

Discuss:

* Why earlier methods stop scaling
* Mob HP vs XP efficiency inflection points
* When to abandon hyperspawns or zone pulls
* Dungeon vs outdoor tradeoffs post-48

End with:

* A clear decision tree for 48–60
* Common mistakes that waste the final hours

---

## Closing Notes

This guide intentionally prioritizes:

* Predictability over novelty
* Repeatable systems over one-off tricks
* Helper leverage over individual heroics

Updates should track:

* Server-specific tuning
* Spawn behavior changes
* Anniversary-specific mechanics
