# Paladin TBC Anniversary Classic – Preparation Guide

> A practical guide for preparing Paladins for TBC Anniversary Classic, focused on maximum xp rates post boosting nerfs.

## 1. Helpers Dictates Overall Strategy

**Core premise:** The number of available helpers changes which approach should be taken. 

With dungeon boosting xp killed by Blizzard, mob tagging is the new form of boosting.  

The low level character must tag and deal 40% of the enemy's hp to gain full xp.  

The fastest possible approach to leveling will be doing zone-wide aoe pulls like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMHqKeDvrBk).

Unfortunately, this approach requires a minimum of 2 60's helping, typically 4 or more as levels increase.  It is unlikely that any guild reaches the player time investment required to offer this service to their    guildies - most likely the only people who take this approach will be streamers and/or people paying. 

A much more realistic helper count would be 0, your own dualbox, or 1 friend.  A level 60 warrior/druid can set up an untagged aoe pull for you (via demo shout/roar) at low levels only, but as enemy mobs near level 20, your pull size for solo tank will start to become limited.  

If your helper class is anything except warrior/druid, or if competition in the zone or enemy mob levels have made aoe impractical, your approach should be single target ret.  

Single target levelers will focus on hyperspawns and potentially some kill quests.

## 2. Types of Helpers

Not all helpers are equal.  Quantity and class both matter.

Class roles:

* **War/Druid** pull mobs, druid can give thorns to paladin and self heal large pulls
* **Mage** improved fireblast spec, portals
* **Rogue/Lock/Hunter/Priest/Shaman** dps choices for killing tagged mobs, some better/worse, no extra tools
* **Healers** useful for zone-wide aoe pulls at 60, and/or 1x level 32 shaman to heal dungeons
* **Summoners** as useful as the function of their location, some are very high yield (Org bank, hillsbrad fields), some are minor gain compared to alternatives (barrens harpies, SM portal).  

For a solo helper until level 20:

druid > war > mage > other 

From 20-32:

mage > druid > war > other

## 3. Items and Professions

Aoe levelers will need to get [Explosive Rockets](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1178) from alliance either via AH or hand leveling.  They will level engi for dynamites and sappers using any of the existing guides out there, generally leveling as the pulls are set up where possible.  

Single target levelers can review these gear snapshots for ideas on pre-gearing your character.  I'm taking this approach personally and am twinked in every item slot.  

[Level 1](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/hu5PKB8sUk9zQdzDGVMCJK)

[Level 20](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/bVxtYXqHUW7CifofrJ7v4r)

[Level 32](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/okBa9at4cZJdbT7TJMeTho)

[Level 40](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/kPpCErA1oHmLKQ2hNtmi23)

[Level 47](https://sixtyupgrades.com/tbc/set/pyqZ4JF9vbZjsQhML28JgZ)

Ret players can also consider low level battle elixirs for str/agi.  

To access the engineering helm at level 10, you must stop leveling and push engi to 120.  This may not be worth the xph loss but the helm lasts until level 25 or higher and [Humbert's Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4724) is notoriously expensive.

## 4. World Buffs and Summons

Haste is disproportionately stronger at lower levels in TBC, so WCB is insane.  Ony is just overtuned for low levels, so it's also insane.  Ideally, our runs will all start by summoning to Org and getting Rend/Ony drops.  

You do not need both buffs to start leveling, even just one is plenty of firepower for low levels.  

Running a mage to Silvermoon for the portal is recommended as long as you don't have to stop leveling to do this.  

Some ideas for summoner team locations include Org, each hyerspawn on your itinerary, SM portal, tanaris, ZF portal, your level 60 dungeon of choice.

## 5. Hyperspawns

Hyperspawns are the tool of choice for ret levelers.  Due to our gear and wbuffs, it is reasonable to start any location 3 levels lower than the enemies.  Here's a list of the hyerspawns I plan to use, but it is not comprehensive:

8-12 Durotar, Quillboar in far west camp near bridge to Barrens

12-18 Silverpine, Gnolls in northwest farm

14-20 Barrens, Harpies in Northeast, not a hyperspawn in some areas but so many mobs that it doesn't matter

17-26 Wetlands, Gnolls in Southeast, famous spot on alliance but draenei levelers are unlikely to be caught up with first wave of blood elf levelers

18-30 Hillsbrad, Humans all over the farms in the east, well known spot

28-32 1k Needles, Harpy Cave in Northeast, remote and unlikely to be contested

27-34 Ashenvale, Worgen in enclave near Felwood border

34-45 Dustwallow Marsh, Murlocs at the famous islands


Strategy here is the same for all locations: smash the mob for 40% of its hp, kill it instantly with a 60 char, repeat. 

Aoe levelers shouldn't have much interest in these locations unless they're between pulls for some reason.

## 6. Dungeon Cleave

It's unlikely that playing normally in a cleave will yield more xp than open world grinding with helpers, but it will be less mentally taxing by far. 

Since ret dps is generally awful for low level dungeons your options are to play Prot, Holy, or skip low levels.  

In the interest of low stress, helping guildie paladins, and actually maintaining good xph, my recommendation is to start dungeons in SM and stay until level 48. 

The comp I want to run is 4x Ret, 1x Rsham.  Shaman gets WF totem at 32, so we'll start with Lib+GY spam at that time.  The shaman doesn't need to be twinked, just drop WF and heal.  

SM 32 to 41, ZF 41 to 48 will work, but mixing in other quests or dungeons to break up monotony would be fine and minimal loss.

## 8. 48–60 Transition

At 48, the key change is that you're now allowed to enter Scholo, Strat, and Dire Maul.  All of these dungeons still provide xp when killed by level 60's under the new rules, so you can enter and play with any geared 60 character.  Unfortunately, the mage boosts in these dungeons are not healthy during TBC prepatch.  

At 50, you can enter ZG.  On top of XP still being available, mage boost still works.

Since you need Argent Dawn rep to enter Naxx, use Strat/Scholo to level 48-50 at least, then transition to ZG once you reach Honored with AD.  

If you're not being supported by guildmates or don't have gold to buy ZG boosts, just finish the dungeon grind normally instead.

## Call to Arms

If you're reading this you're likely either leveling a paladin or curious what we'll be up to.  At this time, we need more level 32 shaman helpers as well as level 60 tag killers of any class. 

The leveling journey without boosting is going to be long and monotonous so we will need to chip away at it rather than try to swallow it whole.  

Helpers are not signing up for permanent servitude to their paladin leveler friend, rather helping in increments where possible.  Many hands makes light work, the more helpers we have, the less we will need from each.
